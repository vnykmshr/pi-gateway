# ShellCheck configuration for Pi Gateway project
# Disable overly strict rules while maintaining meaningful checks

# Disable SC2155 - declaring and assigning separately is often unnecessary overhead
disable=SC2155

# Disable SC2034 for unused variables - many are configuration constants
disable=SC2034

# Disable SC1091 - not following sourced files is expected in modular scripts
disable=SC1091

# Disable SC1090 - dynamic sourcing is valid in this configuration-driven project
disable=SC1090

# Disable SC2126 - grep|wc -l vs grep -c is a minor style preference
disable=SC2126

# Disable SC2317 - unreachable code warnings in conditional mock loading
disable=SC2317

# Keep important security and correctness checks enabled:
# SC2086 - Unquoted variables (security risk)
# SC2046 - Quote to prevent splitting (security risk)
# SC2068 - Double quote array expansions
# SC2005 - Useless echo
# SC2004 - $/${} unnecessary on arithmetic variables
# SC2001 - See if you can use parameter expansion instead of sed
