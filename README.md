**Complete Raspberry Pi homelab bootstrap system with automated security hardening, VPN setup, and comprehensive testing infrastructure.**

## Overview

Pi Gateway provides a one-script automated setup for core services while supporting dynamic IP environments. All provisioning is tracked in this repository, following Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles for reliability, reproducibility, and extensibility.

## Quick Start

### One-Command Installation (Recommended)
```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vnykmshr/pi-gateway/main/scripts/quick-install.sh | bash
```

### Manual Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/vnykmshr/pi-gateway.git
cd pi-gateway

# Check system requirements
make check

# Run the setup (on your Raspberry Pi)
make setup
```

### Interactive Setup
```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vnykmshr/pi-gateway/main/scripts/quick-install.sh | bash -s -- --interactive
```
